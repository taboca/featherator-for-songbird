== How to Setup SongBird to Load the Output build dir directory ==

* checkout this project - you probably did it already :) 
* Access your songbird profile directory. In my linux case it is located in ~username/.songbird2/RanDoMN#umB3R/
* put a file named theme@featherator.taboca.com  your ./ profile extensions directory : 
* Make it point to your output-build-chrome directory from this project - make case is: 
* //home/marcio/theme-ff3/featherator/featherator-for-songbird/output-build-chrome
