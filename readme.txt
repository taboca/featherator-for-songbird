Build and customization system that generates an extension for Songbird, which sets a custom theme and additional things. This project is designed to support the customization of themes+extension packages for songbird and maybe can be something else in the future such as build system to generate theme variations, and other package variations, or even be integrated in server-side.

== How to Setup SongBird to Load the Output build dir directory ==

* checkout this project - you probably did it already :)
* Access your songbird profile directory. In my linux case it is located in ~username/.songbird2/RanDoMN#umB3R/
* put a file named theme@featherator.taboca.com  your ./ profile extensions directory :
* Make it point to your output-build-chrome directory from this project - make case is:
* //home/marcio/theme-ff3/featherator/featherator-for-songbird/output-build-chrome
